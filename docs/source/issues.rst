Known Issues & Limitations
==========================
We are aware that Conmo is still in a very early stage of development, so it is likely that as its use increases, various bugs will appear. 
Bugs that are detected will be published on this page in order to make it easier for users to prevent them. However, the Conmo development team is actively looking for and fixing any detected bugs.
Please, if you find a bug/issue that does not appear on this list, we would be grateful if you could email us at mym.inv.uniovi@gmail.com or post an issue on our Github.
