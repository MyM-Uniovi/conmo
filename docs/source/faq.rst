How can I contribute to Conmo?
==============================

Depending on your profile and your intended use, you can contribute in different ways:
The simplest way to contribute to Conmo is to use it to reproduce some experiments and then cite it.
However, you can also contribute by implementing new algorithms, datasets, etc. that can then be used by everyone to perform experiments.
Finally, reporting bugs in the functioning of Conmo can also be considered a way to collaborate with the project.

I don't have a great knowledge of programming, can I still use Conmo?
=====================================================================

Conmo intends to focus on all types of scientists, regardless of their specialisation. Generally speaking, we can distinguish two types of people who will use Conmo: 
    
    1. People who only want to reproduce experiments that are already integrated only need basic programming knowledge, since Python is a simple programming language and the complexity has been largely encapsulated.
    2. People who want to collaborate by adding new algorithms, datasets, etc. need more in-depth programming knowledge. In particular Python language and object-oriented programming. However, the Conmo development team is actively looking for a way to simplify this kind of actions.
