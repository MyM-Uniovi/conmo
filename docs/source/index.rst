What is **Conmo**?
=======================

**Conmo** is a framework developed in Python whose main objective is to facilitate the execution and comparison of different experiments mainly related to Multivariate Time Series.
These experiments consist of a series of concatenated stages forming a pipeline architecture, i.e. the output of one stage is the input of the next one.
This framework aims to provide a way to standarize machine learning experiments, thus being able to reconstruct result tables of scientific papers.
